# Paper Summary Dashboard

A React-based dashboard for displaying summaries of individual research papers, with visualizations to help summarize and present key insights from the content. Each paper will have its own dedicated dashboard to showcase its findings and performance metrics.

## Features

- **Paper Summary Display**: Each paper will have its own dedicated dashboard.
- **Data Visualizations**: Interactive charts and graphs to represent the findings of the research. 

## Hosting

This dashboard is built with **Vite** and will be hosted on **Vercel** for easy deployment. 

- **Vite**: A fast build tool that optimizes the app for development and production.
- **Vercel**: A platform for deploying static sites and serverless functions with seamless integration for React projects.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the main code for the dashboard components.
  - **`components/`**: Contains individual visual components (e.g., charts).
  - **`data/`**: Stores mock or real data used to populate the visualizations.
  - **`App.js`**: The main React component that renders the dashboard.

- **`public/`**: Contains the static files that are served directly to the user (e.g., papers,images).

## How to Add a New Paper Dashboard

1. **Add Data**: In the `data/` folder, create a new file for the paper's data (e.g., `paper1Data.js`).
2. **Create Components**: In `components/`, create any additional components needed to display the paper's data.
3. **Update `App.js`**: Add routing to display the new paper's dashboard or update the existing dashboard to include the new paper's data.
